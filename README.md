# big-decimal
big decimal based on native bigint

Nowadays JS has natively support arbitrary-precision bigint, so we only need wrap bigint and precision, then we get BigDecimal which keep up with the time. Strongly inspired by [bn.js](https://github.com/indutny/bn.js) and [@ethersprojects/bignumber](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/tree/master/packages/bignumber).
